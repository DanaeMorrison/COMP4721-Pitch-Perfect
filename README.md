# Pitch Perfect: Sight Reading Practice App

**Pitch Perfect** is an interactive application designed to help users improve their sight-reading skills in music. Whether you're a beginner learning to identify single notes or an advanced musician practicing chords, Pitch Perfect provides a structured, engaging, and user-friendly experience.

## Key Features
- **Lessons with Single Note Input**: Practice identifying and playing single notes displayed on a staff using a MIDI keyboard. Get immediate feedback on accuracy.
- **Lessons with Chord Input**: Challenge yourself with chord identification exercises and receive detailed feedback on each chord played.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback using color-coded indicators and note-specific guidance to help users understand their performance.
- **Unit-Based Progression**: Lessons are organized into units, allowing users to advance their skills step by step.
- **Customizable Learning Path** (Planned): Users will be able to track progress, revisit past lessons, and customize their practice sessions.

## How It Works
1. **Select a Unit**: Choose from a variety of units tailored to different skill levels and musical concepts.
2. **Practice a Lesson**: Follow on-screen prompts to play single notes or chords on a MIDI keyboard.
3. **Receive Feedback**: View instant feedback indicating correctness and areas for improvement.
4. **Track Your Progress** (Planned): Review your drill results and export progress summaries as PDFs for long-term tracking.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: JavaFX for UI development
- **Hardware**: MIDI keyboard for user interaction

## Current Development Status
This project is currently in the **medium-fidelity prototype** stage. Two core functionalities are implemented:
1. Single note lessons with real-time feedback.
2. Chord lessons with real-time feedback.

Future updates will include:

- Enhanced lesson navigation as well as a tutorial mode.
